# Examples
Some of the tasks I did during my studies.

# TaskOne

Write a program that creates a 10x10 list of random integers between 1 and 100. Then do the following:

(a) Print the list.

(b) Find the largest value in the third row.

# TaskThree

Roll four dice.

What is the probability that the four outcomes are all different?
Compare this probability to the experiment: Roll three dice.

What is the probability that the sum of four outcomes is equal to 13?

# TaskFour
